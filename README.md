# Doctor's scheduler

This is a full-stack application that uses React, Django, and PostgreSQL.

The system has three types of roles

1. Doctor
2. Patient
3. Receptionist

Once the receptionist is added to the system by either using a query or by sending an object to the backend using something like Postman, you will then be able to login as the receptionist and have access to the Create User tab. Here, you can create doctors or patients. If it is the users first time logging in, a sign up page will appear and prompt you to reset your password. Once that is completed you can login into the system and see the dashboard. The dashboard will be customized for the type of user, but currently all types of users can see the same dashboard - which is every user in the system. MVP yet to come...
